                     Distributed Remote Attestation
           draft-wang-rats-distributed-remote-attestation-02

Abstract

   In many deployments, remote attestation is performed within separate
   administrative and trust domains.  Each domain typically operates its
   own management plane and a Remote Attestation Service (RAS) to obtain
   verifier inputs (e.g., endorsement material and reference values) and
   produce attestation results.  At scale, cross-domain scenarios face
   two recurring challenges: (1) enabling policy-controlled transparency
   so that verifiers or relying parties in one domain can discover and
   retrieve selected attestation artifacts from other domains; and (2)
   supporting many-to-many distribution and reuse of verifier inputs and
   verifier outputs without requiring point-to-point integrations.

   This document describes Distributed Remote Attestation (DRA) patterns
   that use a shared publication channel for selected artifacts with
   provenance and access control in mind.  A Distributed Ledger (DL) is
   discussed as one concrete instantiation of such a publication
   channel, including an option to host verification logic on the DL.
   The described patterns are intended to complement existing RATS
   procedures and conceptual messages, and can be realized by other
   tamper-evident publication channels with comparable properties.

1.  Introduction

   Remote attestation is increasingly deployed in federated and multi-
   operator environments where devices, services, and management systems
   span multiple administrative and trust domains.  In practice, each
   trust domain often operates its own Remote Attestation Service (RAS)
   integrated into that domain's management plane, and exposes
   attestation capabilities and artifacts according to local policies.

Internet-Draft                     DRA                      January 2026


   Cross-domain deployments expose a gap that is not primarily about the
   attestation evidence format or the appraisal function itself, but
   about _how attestation artifacts are discovered, distributed, and
   reused_ across domains at scale.  Two pain points are repeatedly
   observed:

   *  _Cross-domain attestation transparency:_ A verifier or relying
      party in domain-A may need to obtain endorsement material,
      reference values, or attestation results that originate in domain-
      B.  Direct point-to-point integration between operational sites
      does not scale, and is often infeasible due to operational domains
      and policy constraints.  Deployments therefore need a policy-
      consensus controlled channel to publish and retrieve selected
      artifacts with clear provenance.

   *  _Many-to-many distribution and reuse of security artifacts:_
      Verifiers appraising heterogeneous attesters need to obtain
      endorser public keys, endorsements, and reference values from
      multiple providers.  Conversely, providers need to distribute
      artifacts to multiple verifiers across domains.  Similar many-to-
      many scaling issues apply when attestation results are shared for
      reuse by other verifiers or relying parties.  Without a shared
      publication channel, each integration becomes a bespoke, brittle
      dependency.

   This document proposes a set of DRA patterns that make selected
   attestation artifacts more reusable across multiple verifiers and
   domains by introducing a shared publication channel.  The publication
   channel is used to distribute: (a) verifier inputs such as endorser
   public keys, endorsements, and reference values; and (b) verifier
   outputs such as attestation results (or pointers/digests).

   A Distributed Ledger (DL) is discussed as one concrete instantiation
   of the publication channel.  DLs provide tamper-evidence and append-
   only provenance, and can be deployed in permissioned settings with
   authenticated writes and controlled reads.  Where appropriate, a DL
   can additionally host verification logic (e.g., smart contracts) to
   record appraisal outcomes in a shared, auditable manner.  The
   patterns in this document are not limited to DLs and can also be
   realized using other tamper-evident publication channels with
   comparable integrity and availability properties.

   The rest of this document is organized as follows: Section 3 defines
   terminology and abbreviations; Section 4 specifies two DRA patterns
   (off-chain attestation/verification with on-channel publication, and
   an option for on-channel verification); and Section 5 discusses
   freshness, access control, governance, and privacy considerations.

4.  DRA Patterns

   This section describes two common patterns for using a DL-backed RAS
   as a publication channel for attestation artifacts.  Both patterns
   assume that RVs and Endorser material (e.g., public keys and
   endorsement metadata) can be published to, and retrieved from, the DL
   under suitable access control policies.

Figure 1 on-chain-based publication and off-chain-based attestation/verification

 Figure 1: DL publication with off-chain attestation and verification

   As shown in Figure 1, attestation evidence exchange and appraisal
   follow existing RATS flows, while the DL is used to publish and
   retrieve verifier inputs and verifier outputs:

   0)  _Registration/publication of inputs:_ Reference Value Providers
      publish RVs to the DL/RAS.  Endorsers publish endorsement-related
      artifacts (e.g., endorser public keys (PK) and/or endorsements) to
      the DL/RAS.  Access control and provenance mechanisms (e.g.,
      permissioning, signatures) are deployment-specific.

   1)  _Freshness proof preparation:_ A freshness challenge/context may



Wang, et al.              Expires 10 July 2026                  [Page 5]

Internet-Draft                     DRA                      January 2026


      be issued by the Verifier, RP, or another authorized requester
      acting under policy (e.g., a domain management function).  The
      challenge can take different forms depending on deployment (e.g.,
      a nonce, an epoch identifier, a timestamp requirement, or a
      context string bound to an intended appraisal).  The Attester uses
      the received challenge/context to construct a _freshness proof_
      that will be included in AE (see step (2)).

   2)  _Evidence (off-chain):_ The Attester generates AE, incorporating
      the freshness proof required by the Verifier, and sends AE to the
      Verifier over an authenticated and integrity-protected channel.

   3)  _Retrieval of appraisal inputs:_ The Verifier retrieves RVs and
      Endorser artifacts (e.g., PK) from the DL/RAS (or from caches
      populated from it), and uses them as appraisal inputs.

   4)  _Result generation and publication:_ The Verifier appraises AE
      using the retrieved RV/PK, and generates AR.

   5)  _Publication of results:_ The Verifier publishes AR (or a
      pointer/digest to AR) to the DL/RAS for cross-domain discovery and
      potential reuse, subject to policy, privacy, and confidentiality
      constraints.

   6)  _Reuse:_ RP retrieves AR from the DL/RAS and decides whether to
      reuse it based on provenance, freshness/validity window, and local
      policy.

Figure 2 on-chain-based publication/attestation/verification

     Figure 2: DL publication with optional on-chain verification

   As shown in Figure 2, it can be beneficial to verify and/or record
   appraisal outcomes in a shared, tamper-evident way.  In this pattern,
   the DL is used for publication as in the previous pattern, and hosts
   verification logic (e.g., smart contracts) or record verifiers'
   appraisal outcomes.

   0)  _Registration/publication of inputs:_ RVs and Endorser artifacts
      (e.g., PK/endorsements) are published to the DL/RAS.  The
      _Registration smart contract_ supports publication authorization,
      schema/version checks, and governance rules.

   1)  _Evidence publication:_ The Attester generates AE and submits it
      to the DL/RAS via the Registration smart contract.  AE could
      include a freshness proof suitable for publication and reuse
      (e.g., timestamp or epoch ID).  The Attester may also obtain/
      derive a public challenge (PC) value to support freshness/
      unpredictability of the subsequent evidence.  A common realization
      is to use a DL-derived value such as a recent block hash (or other
      consensus-derived header material).  The block-generation process



Wang, et al.              Expires 10 July 2026                  [Page 7]

Internet-Draft                     DRA                      January 2026


      (consensus, timestamps, and transaction sets) makes future block
      hashes hard to predict in advance, and the one-way property of
      hash functions prevents an attacker from predefining a desired
      hash by reverse-engineering corresponding block contents.  Such
      selected PC is incorporated into AE in step (2).

   2)  _Verification and result recording (on-chain):_ The _Verification
      smart contract_ (or other on-chain verification logic) verifies AE
      using RVs and Endorser artifacts available from the DL/RAS, and
      checks freshness according to configured policy (e.g., acceptable
      time window / epoch constraints).  The appraisal outcome is
      recorded as AR (or an appraisal log entry) on-chain.  Triggering
      may be initiated by a Verifier, a Relying Party, or automatically
      upon AE submission, subject to policy.

   3)  _Result retrieval:_ The Verifier/RP queries the DL/RAS and
      obtains AR for decision-making and/or reuse.

5.  Discussion

5.1.  Freshness and Reuse

   For the DRA service, the blocks of the DL need to be generated at
   appropriate time intervals, such as every few seconds.  The consensus
   rules trigger the new block generation process periodically through
   preset time parameters.  Even if there is no transaction data within
   a specific period, nodes will still generate an empty block
   containing basic information like the hash of the previous block and
   timestamps according to established algorithms.  This approach aims
   to maintain the continuity of the DL chain structure and the
   orderliness of timestamps, thereby ensuring the freshness and
   validity of PC.

   Artifact Consumers evaluates whether retrieved artifacts are fresh
   enough for their own threat model and acceptable staleness window.
   When ARs are published for reuse, it is recommended that ARs include
   time-of-appraisal and a validity interval, so that downstream
   consumers can make an informed decision.

5.2.  Access Control and Provenance

   The publication channel enforces authorization for publication.
   Consumers validates provenance and integrity (e.g., signatures, trust
   anchors) for retrieved RVs, endorsement material, and ARs.
   Deployments further defines governance for artifact update/rollback
   and caching policies.
